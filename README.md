Ideating upon 2 projects
### [ 1. Raspberry Pi radio](https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Radio/)
#### Ideation:
| Hardware parts used   | Replacable By | Feasibility to replace | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :---:                 | :---:         | :---:                  | :---:      | :---:         |
| Raspberry Pi | ESP32 | Feasible as they can be connected to internet and perform the same functions | They are cheap as compared to Rpi | -- |
| Rotary encoder | Screen display | Not a good option to replace | Currently, very cheap but after replacing we would be having a touch display | Very Costly |
| Audio amplifier | -- | Not a good option to replace | Best option & very cheap as compared to other options | -- |
| Speaker | -- | Necessary part | Necessary part | -- |
| Capacitors and resistors | -- | Necessary parts | Necessary Parts | -- |

These are the things which we could change:
<br />1. Using ESP32 instead of Raspberry Pi as they can perform similar tasks over internet that we want to do. Cost price of Raspberry Pi 3 is 2714 INR whereas cost price of ESP32 is 595 INR which is much cheaper than Raspberry Pi 3. Also, also the functions required in this project can be easily performed by ESP32 like connecting to the internet and downloading the radio files which we want to listen to. It can also be coded to receive the values from the rotary encoder and play the radio station accordingly. It can also drive the audio amplifier which will amplify the audio so that loudspeakers can play the audio.
<br />2. Use of isolation transformer to remove noise that is present. Each audio channel must go through the isolation transformer to clear any noise present before connecting to the amplifier.
