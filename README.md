Ideating upon 2 projects
### [ 1. Raspberry Pi radio](https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Radio/)
#### Ideation:
| Hardware parts used   | Replacable By | Feasibility to replace | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :---:                 | :---:         | :---:                  | :---:      | :---:         |
| Raspberry Pi | Arduino / microcontroller / NodeMCU | Feasible as they can be connected to internet and perform the same functions | They are cheap as compared to Rpi | -- |
| Rotary encoder | Screen display | Not a good option to replace | Currently, very cheap but after replacing we would be having a touch display | Very Costly |
| Audio amplifier | -- | Not a good option to replace | Best option & very cheap as compared to other options | -- |
| Speaker | -- | Necessary part | Necessary part | -- |
| Capacitors and resistors | -- | Necessary parts | Necessary Parts | -- |

These are the things which we could change:
<br />1. Using arduino/ESP32 instead of Raspberry Pi as they can perform similar tasks over internet that we want to do.
<br />2. Use of isolation transformer to clear noise that are present.
