| Raspberry Pi | Arduino/microcontroller/NodeMCU | Feasible as they can be connected to internet and perform the same functions | They are cheap as compared to Rpi |
| Rotary encoder | Screen display | Not a good option to replace | Currently, very cheap but after replacing we would be having a touch display |
| Audio amplifier | -- | Not a good option to replace | Best option & very cheap as compared to other options |
| Speaker | -- | Necessary part | Necessary part |
| Capacitors and resistors | -- | Necessary parts | Necessary Parts |
